# Lesson Plan â€“ Week 3: From Brainstorm to Proposal (Research, Precedent, Scope)

**Course:** Culmination Project Development  
**Class Session:** #3  
**Date:** 9/11  
**Format:** Zoom (2.5 hours)

---

## **Week 3 Learning Objectives**
By the end of this session, students will:
- Convert brainstorm outputs into structured GitHub issues.
- Explore and document relevant precedents for their project.
- Reflect on and articulate their project scope using a three-level model (PoC, LVP, Aspirational).
- Create personal GitHub Project Boards for tracking tasks.
- Begin drafting a speculative proposal in Markdown.
- Use Zotero and AI tools to support research, citation, and formatting.
- Understand the basics of Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Framework (Lecture 1a).

## **1. Project Scoping Exercise (25 min)**
âœ… **Goal:** Articulate three levels of your project idea and begin defining its complexity.

### **Activities:**
- Create a new Markdown file:
  ```
  project_scope.md
  ```
- Write a short speculative description of your:
  - **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Minimal working model that shows feasibility.
  - **Least Viable Prototype (LVP):** Basic functioning version with core features.
  - **Aspirational Climax:** What the project would look like with no technical or resource limits.

âœ… Outcome: Students create a speculative framework for how their project might grow in complexity.

---

## **2. Create a Personal GitHub Project Board (15 min)**
âœ… **Goal:** Set up the system for managing development milestones and tasks.

### **Activities:**
- Navigate to the class GitHub repository.
- Go to the **Projects** tab â†’ Click **New Project**.
- Title: `[Your Name] â€“ Project Board`
- Add columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Needs Research`, `Completed`
- Link this board in your `README.md`

âœ… Outcome: Project board created and ready to receive Issues.

---

## **3. Translating Brainstorms into GitHub Issues (20 min)**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Issue creation, labels, assignments, linking issues to boards.

### **Activities:**
- Convert brainstorm variants from `brainstorm_variants.md` into separate **GitHub Issues**.
- Assign each issue to yourself.
- Label: `ðŸ§  Idea`, `ðŸŽ¯ Needs Research`, `ðŸš§ Under Consideration`
- Add each issue to your personal **Project Board**.

âœ… Outcome: Students now have modular ideas broken down into manageable GitHub Issues.

---

## **4. Precedent Research + Zotero (20 min)**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Searching for prior art, source management, citation tagging.

### **Activities:**
- Add at least 2 precedent sources to the **class Zotero Group**.
- Tag each with relevant themes (e.g., `interaction design`, `gamification`, `projection`, etc.).
- Annotate each with a 1â€“2 sentence summary or critique.
- Document precedents in:
  ```
  precedent_research.md
  ```
  - Include title, citation, brief insight, and link to source.

âœ… Outcome: Students begin connecting their idea to precedent work.

---

## **5. AI for Precedent Summarization + Markdown Conversion (20 min)**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** AI-enhanced summarization and formatting.

### **Activities:**
- Use an AI tool to summarize one precedent source.
- Convert the summary into **Markdown format** for GitHub.
- Optional: Ask AI to suggest how the precedent might enhance or alter your idea.

âœ… Outcome: Better-quality annotations + structured GitHub documentation.

---

## **6. Refine Your README.md (20 min)**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Vision and project scoping in Markdown.

### **Activities:**
Update your `README.md` to include:
- **Project Overview**
- Link to `project_scope.md`
- Link to `speculative_proposal.md`
- Link to `brainstorm_variants.md`
- Link to `precedent_research.md`
- Link to GitHub Project Board

âœ… Outcome: README becomes the dashboard for project documentation and tracking.

---

## **7. BBS Framework Lecture â€“ Part 1a (15â€“20 min)**
âœ… **Content Introduced:** Core principles of the Balanced Blended Space framework.

### **Topics Covered:**
- What is BBS?
- Role of mediation and blended space in design.
- Why AI is a collaborator, not a tool.
- How project scoping and PoC/LVP/Aspirational Climax fit within the BBS model.

âœ… Outcome: Students understand theoretical foundations for cross-modal design thinking.

---

## **8. Final Wrap-Up + Assignment Launch (5 min)**
âœ… **Wrap-Up:**
- Push `README.md`, `project_scope.md`, `precedent_research.md`, and any new Issues to your branch.
- Confirm that your GitHub Project Board is live and populated.

âœ… **Homework Preview:**
- Expand your speculative proposal based on your new research.
- Add 1â€“2 more research-based Issues.
- Prepare for tool selection, timelines, and design schematics in Week 4.
